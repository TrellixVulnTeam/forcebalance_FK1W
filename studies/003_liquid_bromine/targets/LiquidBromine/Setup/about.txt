In this directory I set up the liquid bromine simulations.

I probably started by writing the .itp file by hand.

Then I wrote the .gro file for the monomer by hand.

Gas-phase Bromine
    2
    1Br     Br1    1   0.128321   1.799782   0.521545
    1Br     Br2    2  -0.073624   1.930111   0.484734
   2.055630   2.055630   2.055630

Next I wrote the .top files by hand (these are easy too)

#include "bro.itp"

[ system ]
Liquid Bromine

[ molecules ]
BRO 100

I created the liquid .gro file with genbox, knowing the experimental density of bromine, don't remember if I had to make the box bigger.
I minimized the energy, ran some MD, and saved a box after ~50 ps for liquid.gro
