""" @package abinitio_gmxx2 Force and energy matching with interface to modified GROMACS.

In order for us to obtain the objective function in force and energy
matching, we loop through the snapshots, compute the energy and force
(as well as its derivatives), and sum them up.  The details of the
process are complicated and I won't document them here.  The contents
of this package (mainly the AbInitio_GMXX2 class) allows us to
call the modified GROMACS to compute the objective function for us.

    """ForceBalance class for force and energy matching with the modified GROMACS.

    This class allows us to use a heavily modified version of GROMACS
    (a major component of this program) to compute the objective
    function contribution.  The modified GROMACS does the looping
    through snapshots, computes the interactions as well as the
    derivatives, and sums them up to build the objective function.
    I will write that documentation elsewhere, perhaps when I port
    GROMACS over to version 4.5.4.

    This class implements the 'get_energy_force_' method.  When it is
    called, the force field is printed to the temporary directory
    along with several files containing the information needed by the
    modified GROMACS (the Boltzmann weights, the parameters that need
    derivatives and their values, the QM energies and forces, and the
    energy / force weighting.)

    The modified GROMACS is called with the arguments '-rerun all.gro
    -fortune -rerunvsite' to loop over the snapshots, turn on force
    matching functionality and reconstruct virtual site positions (an
    important consideration if we're changing the virtual site
    positions in the optimization).  Its outputs are 'e2f2bc' which
    means 'energy squared, force squared, boltzmann corrected' and
    contains the objective function, 'a1dbc' and 'a2dbc' containing
    analytic first and second derivatives, 'gmxboltz' containing the
    Boltzmann weights used, and possibly some other stuff.

    Most importantly, 'e2f2bc', 'a1dbc' and 'a2dbc' are read by 'get'
    after GROMACS is called and returned directly as the objective
    function contributions.

    Other methods implemented in this class are related to the
    preparation of the temp directory.

        - bp        : The QM vs. MM Boltzmann weight proportionality factor

        when the force field is updated.  This required a TON of implementation into the
        modified Gromacs, but in the end we didn't find it to be very useful.  It basically
        emphasizes energy minima and gets barrier heights wrong.  Blah! :)
        - fitatoms  : The number of atoms that we're fitting, which may be less than the total
        number in the QM calculation (i.e. if we are fitting something to be compatible with
        a water model ...)

        - ztemp     : Template for Z-matrix coordinates (for internal coordinate forces)
        - pids      : Information for building interaction name -> parameter number hashtable

        and bypass the coordinate transformation by setting self.usepvals to True.

        The physical parameters are printed to 'pvals' for GROMACS to read -
        of course GROMACS knows the parameters already, but this facilitates
        retrieval from the low level subroutines.

        - 'NoDerivatives' to prevent computation of the Hessian AND the gradient

        GROMACS is called in the callgmxx2() method.
