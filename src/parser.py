""" @package parser Input file parser for ForceBalance projects.  Additionally, the location for all default options.

Although I will do my best to write good documentation,
for many programs the input parser becomes the most up-to-date
source for documentation.  So this is a great place to write
lots of comments for those who implement new functionality.

Basically, the way my program is structured there is a set of
GENERAL options and also a set of SIMULATION options.  Since
there can be many fitting simulations within a single project
(i.e. we may wish to fit water trimers and hexamers, which
constitutes two fitting simulations) the input is organized
into sections, like so:

$options\n
gen_option_1 Big\n
gen_option_2 Mao\n
$simulation\n
sim_option_1 Sniffy\n
sim_option_2 Schmao\n
$simulation\n
sim_option_1 Nifty\n
sim_option_2 Jiffy\n
$end

In this case, two sets of simulation options are generated in addition to the general option.

Each option is meant to be parsed as a certain variable type.

- String option values are read in directly; note that only the first two words in the line are processed
- Some strings are capitalized when they are read in; this is mainly for function tables like OptTab and SimTab
- List option types will pick up all of the words on the line and use them as values,
plus if the option occurs more than once it will aggregate all of the values.
- Integer and float option types are read in a pretty straightforward way
- Boolean option types are always set to true, unless the second word is '0', 'no', or 'false' (not case sensitive)
- Section option types are meant to treat more elaborate inputs, such
as the user pasting in output parameters from a previous job as input,
or a specification of internal coordinate system.  I imagine that for
every section type I would have to write my own parser.  Maybe a
ParsTab of parsing functions would work. :)

To add a new option, simply add it to the dictionaries below and give it a default value if desired.
If you add an entirely new type, make sure to implement the interpretation of that type in the parse_inputs function.
