This package contains an interface to build a Python extension for
MSMS library. SWIG (version 1.3.20 or higher) is used for
generating a C wrapper code.

To build the extension:

python2.4 setup.py build_ext
This will generate a python module ./mslib/msms.py containing shadow 
classes  and the extension - ./build/lib.'platform_specifier'/mslib/_msms.so
(which is also copied to ./mslib).

Note:
There are two C libraries in ./lib/'platform' - libmsms1.3.5.a and
libmsms1.3.5_d.so . By default , the static library libmsms1.3.5.a is
used in building the python extension. To build the extension with
the dynamic library rename libmsms1.3.5_d.so to libmsms1.3.5.so
and copy it in a directory that is in LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

To install msms.py and _msms.so to 
exec_prefix/lib/python2.4/site_packages/mslib:

python2.4 setup.py install
