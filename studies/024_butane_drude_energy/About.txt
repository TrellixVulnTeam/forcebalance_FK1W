Note: All this does is allow ForceBalance to compute single-point energies 
for systems with Drude particles correctly in OpenMM, 
as they are initially placed on top of the parent particle. 
This means the polarization energy is not being taken into account 
if the Drude positions are not moved. ForceBalance can now copy the Drude 
parameters from force field to force field and adjust the positions correctly, 
but there is no official utility for parameterizing Drudes.

It works analogously to standard ForceBalance parameter optimization jobs.
