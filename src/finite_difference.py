    A three-point finite difference stencil.
    This function does either two computations or three,

    This is done in order to avoid recomputing the center
    value many times.

    The first derivative is evaluated using central difference.
    One advantage of using central difference (as opposed to forward
    difference) is that we get zero at the bottom of a parabola.

    Using this formula we also get an approximate second derivative, which
    can then be inserted into the diagonal of the Hessian.  This is very
    useful for optimizations like BFGS where the diagonal determines
    how far we step in the parameter space.

    A function wrapper for finite difference designed for

    formula to wherever we're taking the derivative, and that is prone
