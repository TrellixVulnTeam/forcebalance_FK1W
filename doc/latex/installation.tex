This section covers how to install Force\+Balance.

Currently only Linux is supported, though installation on other Unix-\/based systems (e.\+g. Mac OS) should also be straightforward.

Importantly, note that {\itshape Force\+Balance does not contain a simulation engine}. Instead it interfaces with simulation software like G\+R\+O\+M\+A\+CS, T\+I\+N\+K\+ER, A\+M\+B\+ER or Open\+MM; reference data is obtained from experimental measurements (consult the literature) or from quantum chemistry software (for example, N\+W\+Chem or Q-\/\+Chem).

Several interfaces to existing software packages are provided. However, if you use Force\+Balance for a research project, you should be prepared to write some simple Python code to interface with a software package of your choice. If you choose to do so, please contact me as I would be happy to include your contribution in the main distribution.\hypertarget{installation_installing_forcebalance}{}\subsection{Installing Force\+Balance using conda package manager}\label{installation_installing_forcebalance}
As of version 1.\+7.\+4, Force\+Balance is available as a package on the conda-\/forge channel. To install the package, make sure you are using an Anaconda/\+Miniconda Python distribution for Python versions 2.\+7, 3.\+5, 3.\+6, or 3.\+7, then run\+:

\begin{DoxyVerb}python setup.py install \end{DoxyVerb}


This will install Force\+Balance and all of the required dependencies. It will not install optional dependencies such as Open\+MM, Gromacs, A\+M\+B\+ER, Tinker, C\+C\+Tools/\+Work Queue, or the Open Force Field toolkit.\hypertarget{installation_installing_forcebalance}{}\subsection{Installing Force\+Balance using conda package manager}\label{installation_installing_forcebalance}
Force\+Balance is packaged as a Python module. Here are the installation instructions.

A quick preface\+: Installing software can be a real pain. I tried to make Force\+Balance easy to install by providing clear instructions and minimizing the number of dependencies; however, complications and challenges during installation happen all the time. If you are running into installation problems or having trouble resolving a dependency, please contact me.\hypertarget{installation_installing_forcebalance_prereq}{}\subsubsection{Prerequisites}\label{installation_installing_forcebalance_prereq}

\hypertarget{installation_installing_forcebalance_install}{}\subsubsection{Installing}\label{installation_installing_forcebalance_install}
To install the package, first extract the tarball that you downloaded from the webpage using the command\+:

\begin{DoxyVerb}tar xvzf ForceBalance-[version].tar.gz \end{DoxyVerb}


Alternatively, download the newest Subversion revision from the Sim\+TK website\+:

\begin{DoxyVerb}svn checkout https://simtk.org/svn/forcebalance \end{DoxyVerb}


Upon extracting the distribution you will see this directory structure\+:

\begin{DoxyVerb} <root>

   |- PKG-INFO (Auto-generated package information)
   |- README.txt (Points to the SimTK website)
   |- setup.py (Python script for installation) \end{DoxyVerb}


To install the code into your default Python location, run this (you might need to be root)\+:

\begin{DoxyVerb}python setup.py install \end{DoxyVerb}


You might not have root permissions, or you may want to install the package somewhere other than the default location. You can install to a custom location (for example, to /home/leeping/local) by running\+:

\begin{DoxyVerb}python setup.py install --prefix=/home/leeping/local \end{DoxyVerb}


Assuming your Python version is 2.\+7, the executable scripts will be placed into {\ttfamily /home/leeping/local/bin} and the module will be placed into {\ttfamily /home/leeping/local/lib/python2.7/site-\/packages/forcebalance}.

Note that Python does not always recognize installed modules in custom locations. Any one of the three below options will work for adding custom locations to the Python search path for installed modules\+:

\begin{DoxyVerb}ln -s /home/leeping/local /home/leeping/.local \end{DoxyVerb}
 \begin{DoxyVerb}export PYTHONUSERBASE=/home/leeping/local \end{DoxyVerb}
 \begin{DoxyVerb}export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/home/leeping/local/lib/python2.7 \end{DoxyVerb}


As with the installation of any software, there are potential issues with dependencies (for example, scipy and lxml.) One way to resolve dependencies is to use the Enthought Python Distribution (E\+PD), which contains all of the required packages and is free for academic users. Install E\+PD from the \href{http://www.enthought.com/products/epd.php}{\tt Enthought website}. Configure your environment by running both of the commands below (assuming Enthought was installed to {\ttfamily  /home/leeping/opt/epd-\/7.3.\+2 }, with the python executable in the {\ttfamily bin} subdirectory)\+:

\begin{DoxyVerb} export PATH=/home/leeping/opt/epd-7.3.2/bin:$PATH
 export PYTHONUSERBASE=/home/leeping/opt/epd-7.3.2 \end{DoxyVerb}


An alternative option is to use Anaconda2, that can be downloaded \href{https://www.continuum.io/downloads}{\tt the Continuum website}. It is also free for academic users.

\begin{DoxyVerb} export PATH=/home/leeping/opt/anaconda2/bin:$PATH \end{DoxyVerb}


Once you have done this, the Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib and lxml dependency issues should be resolved and Force\+Balance will run without any problems.

Here are a list of installation notes (not required if you install Force\+Balance into the Enthought Python Distribution). These notes assume that Python and other packages are installed into \$\+H\+O\+ME/local.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The installation of Numpy, Scipy and lxml may be facilitated by installing the {\ttfamily pip} package -\/ simply run a command like {\ttfamily pip install numpy}. \item Scipy requires a B\+L\+AS (Basic Linear Algebra Subroutines) library to be installed. On certain Linux distributions such as Ubuntu, the B\+L\+AS libraries and headers can be found on the repository (run {\ttfamily sudo apt-\/get install libblas-\/dev}). Also, B\+L\+AS is provided by libraries such as A\+T\+L\+AS (Automatically Tuned Linear Algebra Software) or the Intel M\+KL (Math Kernel Library) for Intel processors. To compile Scipy with Intel\textquotesingle{}s M\+KL, follow the guide on \href{http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/numpy-scipy-with-mkl}{\tt Intel\textquotesingle{}s website}. To use A\+T\+L\+AS, install the package from the \href{http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net}{\tt A\+T\+L\+AS website } and set the A\+T\+L\+AS environment variable (for example, {\ttfamily export A\+T\+L\+AS=\$\+H\+O\+ME/local/lib/libatlas.so}) before installing Scipy. \item {\ttfamily lxml} is a Python interface to the libxml2 X\+ML parser. After much ado, I decided to use {\ttfamily lxml} instead of the {\ttfamily xml} module in Python\textquotesingle{}s standard library for several reasons ({\ttfamily xml} contains only limited support for X\+Path, scrambles the ordering of attributes in an element, etc.) The downside is that it can be harder to install. Installation instructions can be found on the \href{http://lxml.de/installation.html}{\tt lxml website} but summarized here. The packages {\ttfamily libxml2} and {\ttfamily libxslt} need to be installed first, and in that order. On Ubuntu, run {\ttfamily sudo apt-\/get install libxml2-\/dev libxslt1-\/dev}. To compile from source, run {\ttfamily ./configure --prefix=\$\+H\+O\+ME/local --with-\/python=\$\+H\+O\+ME/local}. Then run {\ttfamily make} followed by {\ttfamily make install}. Python itself needs to be compiled with {\ttfamily --enable-\/shared} for this to work. Finally, download and unzip {\ttfamily lxml}, then run {\ttfamily  python setup.\+py install --prefix=\$\+H\+O\+ME/local }.\end{DoxyItemize}
\hypertarget{installation_create_doc}{}\subsection{Create documentation}\label{installation_create_doc}
This documentation is created by Doxygen with the Doxypy plugin. To create new documentation or expand on what\textquotesingle{}s here, follow the examples in the source code or visit the Doxygen home page.

To create this documentation from the source files, go to the {\ttfamily doc} directory in the distribution and run {\ttfamily  doxygen doxygen.\+cfg } to generate the H\+T\+ML documentation and La\+TeX source files. Run the {\ttfamily add-\/tabs.\+py} script to generate the extra navigation tabs for the H\+T\+ML documentation. Then go to the {\ttfamily latex} directory and type in {\ttfamily make} to build the P\+DF manual (You will need a La\+TeX distribution for this.) All of this is automated by running {\ttfamily make-\/all-\/documentation.\+sh}.\hypertarget{installation_install_gmxx2}{}\subsection{Installing G\+R\+O\+M\+A\+C\+S-\/\+X2}\label{installation_install_gmxx2}
{\itshape  G\+R\+O\+M\+A\+C\+S-\/\+X2 is not required for Force\+Balance and is currently deprecated. Installation is not recommended. This section is retained for your information and in case I choose to revive the software. }

I have provided a specialized version of G\+R\+O\+M\+A\+CS (dubbed version 4.\+0.\+7-\/\+X2) on the \href{https://simtk.org/home/forcebalance/}{\tt Sim\+TK website} which interfaces with Force\+Balance through the abinitio\+\_\+gmxx2 module. Although interfacing with unmodified simulation software is straightforward, G\+R\+O\+M\+A\+C\+S-\/\+X2 is optimized for force field optimization and makes things much faster.

G\+R\+O\+M\+A\+C\+S-\/\+X2 contains major modifications from G\+R\+O\+M\+A\+CS 4.\+0.\+7. Most importantly, it enables computation of the objective function and its analytic derivatives for rapid energy and force matching. There is also an implementation of the Q\+T\+P\+IE fluctuating-\/charge polarizable force field, and the beginnings of a G\+R\+O\+M\+A\+C\+S/\+Q-\/\+Chem interface (carefully implemented but not extensively tested). Most of the changes were added in several new source files (less than ten)\+: {\ttfamily qtpie.\+c}, {\ttfamily fortune.\+c}, {\ttfamily fortune\+\_\+utils.\+c}, {\ttfamily fortune\+\_\+vsite.\+c}, {\ttfamily fortune\+\_\+nb\+\_\+utils.\+c}, {\ttfamily zmatrix.\+c} and their corresponding header files, and {\ttfamily fortunerec.\+h} for the force matching data structure. The name \textquotesingle{}fortune\textquotesingle{} derives from back when this code was called For\+Tune.

The force matching functions are turned on by calling {\ttfamily mdrun} with the command line argument {\ttfamily \textquotesingle{}-\/fortune\textquotesingle{}} ; without this option, there should be no impact on the performance of normal MD simulations.

Force\+Balance interfaces with G\+R\+O\+M\+A\+C\+S-\/\+X2 through the functions in {\ttfamily abinitio\+\_\+gmxx2.\+py} ; the objective function and derivatives are computed and printed to output files. The interface is defined in {\ttfamily fortune.\+c} on the G\+R\+O\+M\+A\+CS side. Force\+Balance needs to know where the G\+R\+O\+M\+A\+C\+S-\/\+X2 executables are located, and this is specified using the {\ttfamily gmxpath} option in the input file.\hypertarget{installation_install_gmxx2_prerequisites}{}\subsubsection{Prerequisites for G\+R\+O\+M\+A\+C\+S-\/\+X2}\label{installation_install_gmxx2_prerequisites}
G\+R\+O\+M\+A\+C\+S-\/\+X2 needs the base G\+R\+O\+M\+A\+CS requirements and several other libraries.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item F\+F\+TW version 3.\+3 \item G\+Lib version 2.\+0 \item Intel M\+KL library\end{DoxyItemize}
G\+Lib is the utility library provided by the G\+N\+O\+ME foundation (the folks who make the G\+N\+O\+ME desktop manager and G\+T\+K+ libraries). G\+R\+O\+M\+A\+C\+S-\/\+X2 requires G\+Lib for its hash table (dictionary).

G\+Lib and F\+F\+TW can be compiled from source, but it is much easier if you\textquotesingle{}re using a Linux distribution with a package manager. If you\textquotesingle{}re running Ubuntu or Debian, run {\ttfamily sudo apt-\/get install libglib2.\+0-\/dev libfftw3-\/dev}; if you\textquotesingle{}re using Cent\+OS or some other distro with the yum package manager, run {\ttfamily sudo yum install glib2-\/devel.\+x86\+\_\+64 fftw3-\/devel.\+x86\+\_\+64} (or replace {\ttfamily x86\+\_\+64} with {\ttfamily i386} if you\textquotesingle{}re not on a 64-\/bit system.

G\+R\+O\+M\+A\+C\+S-\/\+X2 requires the Intel Math Kernel Library (M\+KL) for linear algebra. In principle this requirement can be lifted if I rewrite the source code, but it\textquotesingle{}s a lot of trouble, plus M\+KL is faster than other implementations of B\+L\+AS and L\+A\+P\+A\+CK.

The Intel M\+KL can be obtained from the Intel website, free of charge for noncommercial use. Currently G\+R\+O\+M\+A\+C\+S-\/\+X2 is built with M\+KL version 10.\+2, which ships with compiler version 11.\+1/072 ; this is not the newest version, but it can still be obtained from the Intel website after you register for a free account.

After installing these packages, extract the tarball that you downloaded from the website using the command\+:

\begin{DoxyVerb}tar xvjf gromacs-[version]-x2.tar.bz2 \end{DoxyVerb}


The directory structure is identical to G\+R\+O\+M\+A\+CS 4.\+0.\+7, but I added some shell scripts. {\ttfamily Build.\+sh} will run the configure script using some special options, compile the objects, create the executables and install them; you will probably need to modify it slightly for your environment. The comments in the script will help further with installation.

Don\textquotesingle{}t forget to specify the install location of the G\+R\+O\+M\+A\+C\+S-\/\+X2 executables in the Force\+Balance input file!
