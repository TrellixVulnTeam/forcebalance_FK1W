About this directory:

Sample ForceBalance job for fitting VdW parameters of chlorine,
using two simple data sets (dichloromethane and chloroform).

Prerequisites:

Have TINKER somewhere in your path (it needs to be able to find "analyze", "testgrad" etc.)

My emailed instructions to Stephen Fried, who generated the
conformations from condensed phase AMOEBA simulations:

"""
For each solvent, provide:

1) A minimized monomer geometry using the current force field
(i.e. VdW shouldn't matter for the monomer geometry.)

2) A set of dimer geometries evenly spaced in separation and with
randomly sampled orientations.  You can extract these from the liquid
simulation; provide about 50 geometries per 0.1 Angstrom separation,
starting from the closest sampled distance and ending at that distance
+ 2.0 Angstrom (so a total of 1000 geometries).  I don't think we need
to worry about sampling the orientations evenly.

I will superimpose the monomer geometry onto each molecule in the
dimer geometry, so that there is no vibrational noise in the reference
data.  (If you're feeling adventurous, feel free to do this yourself.)
I'll run a QM calculation on each dimer geometry to obtain an energy
curve.
"""

After superimposing the TINKER-minimized monomer onto each molecule in the dimer,
I performed a RIMP2/aug-cc-pVTZ energy calculation on each dimer geometry.  Then
I processed these to create "all.arc" and "qdata.txt" for each molecule, and they
were placed into the "simulations" directory.

Once this is all set up, I ran "ForceBalance -f optimize.in".
