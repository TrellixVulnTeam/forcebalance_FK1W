    """ Subclass of FittingSimulation for force and energy matching.

    Currently Gromacs-X2, Gromacs, Tinker and OpenMM are supported.

    In force and energy matching, we introduce the following concepts:
    - The number of snapshots
    - The reference energies and forces (eqm, fqm) and the file they belong in (qdata.txt)
    - The sampling simulation energies (emd0)
    - The WHAM Boltzmann weights (these are computed externally and passed in)
    - The QM Boltzmann weights (computed internally using the difference between eqm and emd0)

    There are also these little details:
    - Switches for whether to turn on certain Boltzmann weights (they stack)
    - Temperature for the QM Boltzmann weights
    - Whether to fit a subset of atoms

    This subclass contains the 'get' method for building the objective
    function from any simulation software (a driver to run the program and
    read output is still required).  The 'get' method can be overridden
    by subclasses like ForceEnergyMatch_GMXX2."""

        """ Read the reference data (for force and energy matching)
        from a file such as qdata.txt.

        @todo Add an option for picking any slice out of
        qdata.txt, helpful for cross-validation
        
        @todo Closer integration of reference data with program -
        leave behind the qdata.txt format?  (For now, I like the
        readability of qdata.txt)

        After reading in the information from qdata.txt, it is converted
        into the GROMACS energy units (kind of an arbitrary choice);
        forces (kind of a misnomer in qdata.txt) are multipled by -1
        to convert gradients to forces.

        We also subtract out the mean energies of all energy arrays
        because energy/force matching does not account for zero-point
        energy differences between MM and QM (i.e. energy of electrons
        in core orbitals).

        The configurations in force/energy matching typically come
        from a the thermodynamic ensemble of the MM force field at
        some temperature (by running MD, for example), and for many
        reasons it is helpful to introduce non-Boltzmann weights in
        front of these configurations.  There are two options: WHAM
        Boltzmann weights (for combining the weights of several
        simulations together) and QM Boltzmann weights (for converting
        MM weights into QM weights).  Note that the two sets of weights
        'stack'; i.e. they can be used at the same time.

        A 'hybrid' ensemble is possible where we use 50% MM and 50% QM
        weights.  Please read more in LPW and Troy Van Voorhis, JCP
        Vol. 133, Pg. 231101 (2010), doi:10.1063/1.3519043.
        
        @todo The WHAM Boltzmann weights are generated by external
        scripts (wanalyze.py and make-wham-data.sh) and passed in;
        perhaps these scripts can be added to the ForceBalance
        distribution or integrated more tightly.

        Finally, note that using non-Boltzmann weights degrades the
        statistical information content of the snapshots.  This
        problem will generally become worse if the ensemble to which
        we're reweighting is dramatically different from the one we're
        sampling from.  We end up with a set of Boltzmann weights like
        [1e-9, 1e-9, 1.0, 1e-9, 1e-9 ... ] and this is essentially just
        one snapshot.  I believe Troy is working on something to cure
        this problem.

        Here, we have a measure for the information content of our snapshots,
        which comes easily from the definition of information entropy:

        S = -1*Sum_i(P_i*log(P_i))
        InfoContent = exp(-S)

        With uniform weights, InfoContent is equal to the number of snapshots;
        with horrible weights, InfoContent is closer to one.

        This subroutine builds the objective function (and optionally
        its derivatives) from a general simulation software.  This is
        in contrast to using GROMACS-X2, which computes the objective
        function and prints it out; then 'get' only needs to call
        GROMACS and read it in.

        This subroutine interfaces with simulation software 'drivers'.
        The driver is only expected to give the energy and forces.

        Now this subroutine may sound trivial since the objective
        function is simply a least-squares quantity (M-Q)^2 - but
        there are a number of nontrivial considerations.  I will list
        them here.
        
        0) Polytensor formulation: Because there may exist covariance
        between different components of the force (or covariance
        between the energy and the force), we build the objective
        function by taking outer products of vectors that have the
        form [E F_1x F_1y F_1z F_2x F_2y ... ], and then we trace it
        with the inverse of the covariance matrix to get the objective
        function.

        1) Boltzmann weights and normalization: Each snapshot has its
        own Boltzmann weight, which may or may not be normalized.
        This subroutine does the normalization automatically.
        
        2) Subtracting out the mean energy gap: The zero-point energy
        difference between reference and fitting simulations is
        meaningless.  This subroutine subtracts it out.
        
        3) Hybrid ensembles: This program builds a combined objective
        function from both MM and QM ensembles, which is rigorously
        better than using a single ensemble.

        Note that this subroutine does not do EVERYTHING that
        GROMACS-X2 can do, which includes:
        
        1) Internal coordinate systems
        2) 'Sampling correction' (deprecated, since it doesn't seem to work)
        3) Analytic derivatives
        
        In the previous code (ForTune) this subroutine used analytic
        first derivatives of the energy and force to build the
        derivatives of the objective function.  Here I will take a
        simplified approach, because building the derivatives are
        cumbersome.  For now we will return the objective function
        ONLY.  A two-point central difference should give us the first
        and diagonal second derivative anyhow.
